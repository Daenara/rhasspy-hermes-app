The design philosophy of Rhasspy Hermes App is:

- It should be easy to create a Rhasspy app with minimal boilerplate code.
- All Rhasspy Hermes App code should behave by default in a sensible way.

*********************
Reacting to an intent
*********************

This example app reacts to the default "GetTime" intent that comes with Rhasspy's installation by telling you the current time:

.. literalinclude:: ../time_app.py

Ignoring the import lines and the logger, what this code does is:

* creating a :class:`rhasspyhermes_app.HermesApp` object;
* defining a function ``get_time`` that ends a session by telling the time;
* running the app.

By applying the app's :meth:`rhasspyhermes_app.HermesApp.on_intent` decorator to the function, this function will be called whenever the app receives an intent with the name "GetTime".

Try the example app `time_app.py`_ with the ``--help`` flag to see what settings you can use to start the app (mostly connection settings for the MQTT broker):

.. code-block:: shell

  python3 time_app.py --help

.. _`time_app.py`: https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy-hermes-app/blob/master/time_app.py

******************
Other example apps
******************

The GitHub repository has a couple of other example apps showing the library's functionality:

- `raw_topic_app.py`_
- `raw_topic_list_app.py`_

.. _`raw_topic_app.py`: https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy-hermes-app/blob/master/raw_topic_app.py
.. _`raw_topic_list_app.py`: https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy-hermes-app/blob/master/raw_topic_list_app.py

*******************************
Building an app on this library
*******************************

If the API of this library changes, your app possibly stops working when it updates to the newest release of Rhasspy Hermes App. Therefore, itâ€™s best to define a specific version in your ``requirements.txt`` file, for instance:

.. code-block::

  rhasspy-hermes-app==0.1.0

This way your app keeps working when the Rhasspy Hermes App adds incompatible changes in a new version.

The project adheres to the `Semantic Versioning`_ specification with major, minor and patch version.

Given a version number major.minor.patch, this project increments the:

- major version when incompatible API changes are made;
- minor version when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner;
- patch version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

.. _`Semantic Versioning`: https://semver.org
